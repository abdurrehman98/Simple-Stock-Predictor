# Simple-Stock-Predictor
Basic Stock Prediction done using an SVM and a Linear Regression Model. Predicted Facebooks value of 5 months using 5+ years of testing data.

The simple stock predictor uses two models, the Support Vector Machine, and a Linear Regression
To calculate accuracy, I have used a simple regression analysis using R^2.
Since both models will be measured on fit, the better fitting model should result in an optimized output

Extension; Incomplete -

The Extension of this project would be to create an automated inputting method which can take on stock data of varying companies and varying sources.
Once this is done, a combination of both the SVM and LR, or perhaps a logistic regression involving multiple factors can be conducted to better
train and test the model. Once this is done, the final model needs to be classified using a formalized function rather than globalized variables.
